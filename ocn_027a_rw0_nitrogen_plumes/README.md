## Wastewater Plumes in Coastal Areas Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Global Inputs and Impacts from of Human Sewage in Coastal Ecosystems](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258898) for [display on Resource Watch]({link to dataset's metadata page on Resource Watch}).

This dataset is provided as a series of GeoTIFF files from the data provider to the Resource Watch data team.

To display these data on Resource Watch, each GeoTIFF was translated into the appropriate projection for web display and uploaded to Google Earth Engine.

Please see the [Python script]([{link to Python script on Github}](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/ocn_027a_rw0_nitrogen_plumes/ocn_027a_rw0_nitrogen_plumes_processing.py)) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed {Resource Watch public title} dataset [on Resource Watch]({link to dataset's metadata page on Resource Watch}).

You can also download the original dataset [directly through Resource Watch]({s3 link if available}), or [from the source website](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Ac7bdc77e-6c7d-46b6-8bfc-a66491119d07).

###### Note: This dataset processing was done by [Claire Hemmerly], and QC'd by [Chris Rowe](https://www.wri.org/profile/chris-rowe).
