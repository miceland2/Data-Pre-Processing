## Wastewater Plumes in Coastal Areas Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to the [Global Inputs and Impacts from of Human Sewage in Coastal Ecosystems](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258898) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/11804f04-d9c7-47b9-8d27-27ce6ed6c042).

This dataset is provided as a series of GeoTIFF files from the data provider to the Resource Watch data team.

To display these data on Resource Watch, each GeoTIFF was translated into the appropriate projection for web display and uploaded to Google Earth Engine.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/ocn_027a_rw0_nitrogen_plumes/ocn_027a_rw0_nitrogen_plumes_processing.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed Wastewater Plumes in Coastal Areas dataset [on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/11804f04-d9c7-47b9-8d27-27ce6ed6c042).

You can also download the original dataset [directly through Resource Watch](http://wri-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/resourcewatch/raster/ocn_027_rw0_nitrogen_plumes.zip), or [from the source website](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Ac7bdc77e-6c7d-46b6-8bfc-a66491119d07).
